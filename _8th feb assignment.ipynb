    "QUESTION 2: Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "    #ABSTRACTION:\n",
    "    Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based\n",
    "    on the essential attributes and behaviors of real-world entities.\n",
    "    It allows US to create abstract data types that represent high-level concepts,\n",
    "    hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "    >It focuses on defining the essential features of an object while hiding the implementation details.\n",
    "     >It provides a clear and simplified view of an object.\n",

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "ANSWER: The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\"\n",
    "It provides tools to work with abstract classes and interfaces,\n",
    "allowing you to define abstract base classes and enforce\n",
    "the implementation of certain methods in derived classes.\n",
    "It is a way to introduce a level of structure and hierarchy\n",
    "into class design, making it easier to ensure that\n",
    "classes adhere to certain patterns and provide specific functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used for the following purposes:\n",
    "1)Defining Abstract Base Classes:They serve as templates that define a set of methods\n",
    "that derived classes must implement. The abc module allows you to define abstract \n",
    "methods using the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
    "2)Enforcing Method Implementation: By using abstract base classes,.\n",
    "we can enforce that derived classes implement specific methods.\n",
    "If a subclass fails to implement a required method, attempting to instantiate it will raise an error.\n",
    "3) Polymorphism and Type Checking: Abstract base classes enable polymorphism,\n",
    "allowing us to treat different objects that share a common interface in a uniform way.\n",

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "ANSWERS: Data abstraction can be achieved in python through the use of classes and objects.\n",
    "we can achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "1)Define a Class: Create a class that represents the abstract concept you want to model.\n",
    "This class should define the essential attributes and methods that characterize the concept.\n",

    "2) Encapsulate Data: Encapsulate the data attributes within the class.\n",
    "Use access modifiers to control the visibility and access of these attributes from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Define Methods: Define methods that provide operations related to the data attributes.\n",
    "These methods can be used to modify or interact with the data in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Hide Implementation Details: Expose only the necessary methods and attributes to the user\n",
    "while hiding the complex implementation details. This simplifies the interaction with the object\n",
    "and reduces the complexity for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Provide a Public Interface: Define a clear public interface for the class. \n",

    "intended use of the class and its objects. The user should interact with\n",
